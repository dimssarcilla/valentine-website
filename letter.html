        <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, Maem 💕</h1>
        <p>
            I know we’re not in a relationship, 
            but I still wanted to take this day as a chance to tell you 
            how much I appreciate you. What we have may not have a label, 
            but it feels real to me in the way it makes me smile, 
            in the way it makes my days better, and in the way I naturally 
            look forward to talking to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not really the type who’s into long messages or 
            Valentine’s stuff like this, but I just wanted to show you how 
            much I appreciate you. Sometimes I’m not the best at expressing 
            what I feel, but I didn’t want today to pass without letting 
            you know how important you are to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meeting you wasn’t something I planned, but I’m really grateful 
            it happened. You’ve slowly become someone important to me. 
            I like how easy it is to talk to you, how comfortable everything 
            feels, and how you can change my mood just by being yourself. 
            Those little moments we share might seem simple, but they mean 
            more to me than you probably realize.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m also very thankful for your existence. It might sound simple, 
            but having you in my life right now means so much to me. 
            I’m thankful for the things you do for me — for your time, your 
            effort, your care, even the smallest gestures. You probably don’t 
            even notice how much they matter, but I do. And I truly appreciate 
            all of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not trying to rush us or put pressure on what this is. 
            I just genuinely enjoy what we have right now. Getting to know you, 
            talking to you, sharing random moments — all of it means something 
            to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I just want you to feel valued and appreciated. 
            Even without a label, you’re someone special in my life. And I’m 
            thankful that right now, it’s you I get to care about.
        </p>
        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day. 🤍✨</p>
